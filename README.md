# Walmart-Sales-Dashboard

Walmart is a retailing corporation which operates as various sorts of departmental stores, supermarket, and hypermarket. They have provided their datasets for analyzing or forecasting their information to make a better decision about their sales.

In this project, I have used Walmart’s dataset from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/andredornas/tp2-walmart-sales-forecast/data). The dataset contains anonymized data about the 45 store’s weekly sales and different factors which might have an effect on it. 

The aim of this project is to enable the management of Walmart makes sense of their store’s sale. By understanding and analyzing how external and internal factors are impacting Walmart weekly sales of the products in terms of increasing or decreasing, which include weather condition, unemployment rate, fuel prices, CPI and store size.

Which factors have a strong relationship with sales? Then predicting future sales using statistical prediction models which will help the company to take better data driven decisions for strategic, promotion planning and procedure optimization.

In this project, I figure out that increase in temperature, CPI, and unemployment will have a negative impact on Walmart’s stores’ weekly sales. This retail dashboard will provide Walmart decision team crucial data to enhance their performance with respect to uncontrollable factors when selling any type of products or/and services. Further, provide an insight into customer behavior which can be utilized to adjust or implement sales strategies.
